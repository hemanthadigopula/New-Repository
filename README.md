# 🗓️ 30-Day Challenge: Build Your JARVIS from Scratch

## 🎯 Goal: Learn Python + AI by building real parts of your own JARVIS assistant.
---

## 📍 Week 1: Python Basics + Logic

**Day 1:** Install Python, VS Code, write your first `print("Hello, world")`
**Day 2:** Learn variables, input/output, and basic math
**Day 3:** Master if/else conditions with a number guessing game
**Day 4:** Learn loops — build a countdown timer
**Day 5:** Learn functions — create a reusable greeter
**Day 6:** Lists and dictionaries — build a mini contact book
**Day 7:** Project: Personal Greeter Bot (greets, calculates age, saves name)

---

## 📍 Week 2: Data Storage + Task Bot

**Day 8:** Learn file handling (read/write `.txt`)
**Day 9:** Create and update task list from file
**Day 10:** Add features: delete tasks, mark as done
**Day 11:** Build a menu-driven CLI to-do app
**Day 12:** Learn string formatting and text templates
**Day 13:** Error handling (try/except)
**Day 14:** Project: Smart To-Do Manager (file-based)

## 📍 Week 3: Voice + Assistant Mode

**Day 15:** Install and use `pyttsx3` (Text-to-Speech)
**Day 16:** Use `speech_recognition` to convert voice to text
**Day 17:** Chain speech → command → speech reply
**Day 18:** Add time-telling and jokes module
**Day 19:** Add calculator module (voice math)
**Day 20:** Review + refactor code
**Day 21:** Project: Voice-Controlled JARVIS Lite (5 commands)

## 📍 Week 4: AI & Memory Power

**Day 22:** Understand what an API is (simple demo)
**Day 23:** Connect to OpenAI’s GPT for chat
**Day 24:** Build intent detection: "remind me to...", "who is..."
**Day 25:** Learn about databases (use JSON or SQLite)
**Day 26:** Store and recall facts: name, birthday, fav color
**Day 27:** Add reminder system with clock check
**Day 28:** Project: Memory-Enhanced JARVIS (reminders + personal info)

---

## 📍 Final 2 Days: Wrap Up & Launch

**Day 29:** Polish everything, fix bugs, organize code
**Day 30:** Demo Day — Your Personal AI JARVIS is ready to serve 🧠
